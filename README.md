# Marketing Analytics Data Modeling & BI

This repository contains an end-to-end marketing analytics project focused on SQL-based data modeling and business intelligence reporting. The goal of this project is to transform raw marketing and customer data into analytics-ready tables that support reliable, scalable insights and dashboarding.

## Project Overview
The data layer is designed using dimensional modeling best practices, with clearly defined fact and dimension tables to enable efficient querying, consistent metrics, and downstream BI consumption. SQL transformations are used to build a clean analytical model that captures customer behavior, engagement activity, and review data.

The analytics layer is visualized using Power BI to highlight key marketing and customer performance trends. To keep the repository lightweight and accessible, the Power BI dashboard is documented through screenshots and explanations rather than storing large binary files.

## Repository Structure


## Data Model
- **Dimension Tables**
  - Customers

This structure supports flexible slicing by customer, product, and time while maintaining metric consistency across analyses.

## Analytics & BI
The Power BI dashboard provides insights into:
- Customer engagement trends
- Review activity and sentiment patterns
- Marketing performance indicators
- Customer-level behavior analysis

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- SQL-based data modeling and transformations
- Dimensional (star schema) design
- Analytics engineering best practices
- Business intelligence and dashboard design
- Documentation for reproducible analytics projects

## Notes
The Power BI `.pbix` file is intentionally excluded due to file size limitations. Screenshots and documentation are provided to explain the dashboard structure and metrics.
